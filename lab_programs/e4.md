#### Ex. 4 - FINDING SHORTEST PATHS USING DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM

**Aim:**
> To find the shortest paths from a given vertex in a weighted connected graph to other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm

**Algorithm:**
> 1. Make a list of all of the vertex in the graph  
> 2. Write 0 next to the first vertex  
> 3. Iterate the following steps:  
>   a. Find the vertex that you have not yet drawn a mark next to that has the
smallest number written next to it  
>   b. Draw a mark next to this vertex  
>   c. Do these steps for each other vertex connected to this vertex:  
       (i) Add the number written next to this vertex and the distance of the connection together  
       (ii) If the connected vertex does not have a number written next to it, write the new number and the name of this vertex next to the connected vertex  
       (iii) If the connected vertex has a number written next to it and the new number is smaller than the written number  
          1. Write the new number and the name of this vertex instead  
>   d. Stop when you have drawn a mark next to every vertex in the list

**Program:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
#define infinity 999

void dij(int n, int v, int cost[10][10], int dist[100])
{
  int i, u, count, w, flag[10], min;
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    flag[i] = 0, dist[i] = cost[v][i];
  count = 2;
  while (count <= n)
  {
    min = 99;
    for (w = 1; w <= n; w++)
      if (dist[w] < min && !flag[w])
        min = dist[w], u = w;
    flag[u] = 1;
    count++;
    for (w = 1; w <= n; w++)
      if ((dist[u] + cost[u][w] < dist[w]) && !flag[w])
        dist[w] = dist[u] + cost[u][w];
  }
}

void main()
{
  int n, v, i, j, cost[10][10], dist[10];
  clrscr();
  printf("Enter the number of vertices: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);
  printf("\nEnter the cost matrix:\n");
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
    {
      scanf("%d", &cost[i][j]);
      if (cost[i][j] == 0)
        cost[i][j] = infinity;
    }
  printf("\nEnter the source vertex: ");
  scanf("%d", &v);
  dij(n, v, cost, dist);
  printf("\nShortest Paths from Vertex %d to all other vertices:\n", v);
  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    if (i != v)
      printf("%d -> %d, Cost: %d\n", v, i, dist[i]);
  getch();
}
```

**Output:**
```
Enter the number of vertices: 5

Enter the cost matrix:
0 5 12 17 999
999 0 999 8 7
999 999 0 9 999
999 999 999 0 999
999 999 999 999 0

Enter the source vertex: 1

Shortest Paths from Vertex 1 to all other vertices:
1 -> 2, Cost: 5
1 -> 3, Cost: 12
1 -> 4, Cost: 13
1 -> 5, Cost: 12
```

**Result:**
> Thus the program is executed and the output is verified successfully.
